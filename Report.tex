\section{i. Abstract }

Recent technological advancements have had a drastic impact on the way individuals communicate. In this research, previous studies were analyzed, feld observations were conducted, and an online survey was administered to determine the level of engagement individuals have with their cell phones, other technologies and with each other in face-to-face situations. Findings suggest that technology has a negative effect on both the quality and quantity of face-to-face communication. Despite individuals’ awareness of the decrease of face-to-face communication as a result of technology, more than 62 percent of individuals observed on Makerere main campus continue to use mobile devices in the presence of others. 

\section{1. Introduction.}

Little by little, technology has become an integral part of the way that people communicate with one 
another and has increasingly taken the place of face-to-face communication. Due to the rapid expansion 
of technology, many individuals fear that people may be too immersed in this digital world and not present 
enough in the real world.
Many people have expressed shared concerns regarding the overuse of technology and its impact on face-to-face 
communication, so much so that some restaurants in the United States of America have banned the use of mobile devices to 
ensure customers enjoy both their meal and their company (Forbes, 2013). Throughout this study, the author 
sought to answer questions regarding technology usage and investigated whether technology affects face-to-face communication negatively. 

\section{2. Literature Review}

Before analyzing the effect of technology on face-to-face communication, it is important to understand 
the rapid growth of various technologies and their current usage throughout the United States. Over the past 
few decades, technology usage has grown signifcantly. Per the U.S. Census, 76 percent of households reported 
having a computer in 2011, compared with only 8 percent in 1984 (File, 2012). Of that number, 72 percent of households 
reported accessing the Internet, up from just 18 percent in 1998, the frst year the Census asked about Internet use 
(File, 2012). As of 2013, 90 percent of American adults had a cell phone of some kind, and for people under the age 
of 44, the number was closer to 97 percent (Madrigal, 2013). The drastic increase in technology usage is especially 
noticeable in younger generations. One study, conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, found people 
ages 8 to 18 spent more time on media than on any other activity – at an average of 7.5 hours a day (Rideout, 
Foehr, & Roberts, 2010).

Many studies have been conducted regarding technology’s effect on social interaction and face-to-
face communication since the rise of cellphone and social media usage in the late 2000s. As Przybylski and 
Weinstein of the University of Essex wrote in 2013, “Recent advancements in communication technology 
have enabled billions of people to connect more easily with people great distances away, yet little has been 
known about how the frequent presence of these devices in social settings infuences face-to-face interac-
tions” (Przybylski & Weinstein, 2012, p. 1).

One study examined the relationship between the presence of mobile devices and the quality of real-
life, in-person social interactions. In a naturalistic feld experiment, researchers found that conversations in 
the absence of mobile communication technologies were rated as signifcantly superior compared with those 
in the presence of a mobile device (Misra, Cheng, Genevie, and Yuan, 2014). People who had conversations 
in the absence of mobile devices reported higher levels of empathetic concern, while those conversing in the 
presence of a mobile device reported lower levels of empathy (Misra et al., 2014). 
In another study, Przybylski and Weinstein (2012) showed similar results that proved the presence of 
mobile communication devices in social settings interferes with human relationships. In two separate experi-
ments, the authors found evidence that these devices have negative effects on closeness, connection, and 
conversation quality, especially notable when individuals are engaging in personally meaningful topics.  

Though much research has shown the negative effects of technology on face-to-face interaction, one 
study found that cell phone use in public might make individuals more likely to communicate with strangers. 
In 2011, Campbell and Kwak (2011) examined whether and how mobile communication infuences the extent 
to which one engages face to face with new people in public settings. By accounting for different types of cell 
phone uses, the study found evidence that mobile phone use in public actually facilitated talking with copre-
sent strangers, for those who frequently rely on cell phones to get and exchange information about news.
Brignall and van Valey (2005) analyzed the effects of technology among “current cyber-youth” – those 
who have grown up with the Internet as an important part of their everyday life and interaction rituals. The two 
authors discovered that due to the pervasive use of the Internet in education, communication and entertain-
ment, there has been a signifcant decrease in face-to-face interaction among youth. They suggest that the 
decrease in the amount of time youth spend interacting face-to-face may eventually have “signifcant conse-
quences for their development of social skills and their presentation of self” (p. 337). 

Many other authors have focused specifcally on technology’s effect on personal relationships. In  
Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less From Each Other,  Turkle (2012) examined 
the effects of technology on familial relationships. After interviewing more than 300 young people and 150 
adults, Turkle found that children were often times the ones complaining about their parents’ obsession with 
technology. Turkle discovered that many children believed their parents paid less attention to them than to 
their smartphones, often times neglecting to interact with them face to face until they had fnished responding 
to emails.
Contrary to many researchers’ beliefs that technology impacts face-to-face communication negatively, 
Baym, principal researcher at Microsoft Research, does not share these concerns. Rather, Baym believes 
that research suggests digital communications enhance relationships and that “the evidence consistently 
shows that the more you communicate with people using devices, the more likely you are to communicate 
with those people face to face” (Adler, 2013).

The literature review above dominantly shows that the use of mobile technologies for recreational purposes typically affects face-to-face interactions with strangers, acquaintances, and families alike in a nega-
tive manner. Based on the review, the following three research questions were asked in this study:
RQ1. How does the use of technology affect people’s ability to communicate face to face? 
RQ2. Does the mere presence of technology affect people’s ability to communicate with individuals in 
a public place?
RQ3. Has the increase of technology decreased both the quantity and quality of face-to-face interac-
tions?

\section{5. Methods}

The author conducted feld observations and a survey to measure the level of engagement Elon stu-
dents have with their cell phones, other technologies, and each other in face-to-face situations. 
The survey was administered to Elon University students who were recruited using a non-probability 
sample via Facebook and email. Students were asked 11 questions regarding their technology use, habits, 
perceptions of face-to-face communication in the presence of technology, and engagement both face to face 
and screen to screen, which would help better answer the question of whether technology has a negative ef-
fect on face-to-face communication (For a full list of survey questions, reference Appendix A).
The survey resulted in 100 responses.
Based on the survey fndings, feld observations were conducted at four highly populated areas on 
campus, including dining halls. Observations were conducted during heavy foot-traffc times, including in-
between classes and during lunch hours, when students would most likely be present and interacting with 
others. A variety of different interactions between other students and technology were recorded, including 
those texting or talking on the phone, those interacting with others, and those who did not have contact with 
devices. (Refer to Appendix B to see a full description of feld observations). 

\section{6. Findings}
All 100 respondents owned a smartphone or tablet. When asked how frequently students use their 
cell phones, 60 percent of respondents said they use their phone more than 4 hours a day, with 18 percent of respondents 
admitting to more than 8 hours of usage a day. Almost all students (97 percent) bring their cell phones or tablets 
with them every time they leave the house and only one respondent said they rarely do. Some students 
(18 percent) reported that when spending time with friends or family, they always use their cell phone or tablet. The 
majority of students use their cell phone sometimes when they are with family or friends (74 percent), and only 8 percent 
of students rarely use their phone in the presence of friends and family. No respondents indicated that they 
never use their cell phone or tablet when spending time with friends or family. Additionally, 46 percent of re-
spondents said they communicate with friends or family more frequently via technology than in person, while 
26 percent said the opposite.  
Field observations yielded similar results regarding technology use and habits among Elon students. 
Of more than 200 students observed, 69 percent were using technology in one way or another. The author found 
that 78 of 134 students observed alone (58 percent) were either texting or holding their phones, 21 (16 percent) were talk-
ing on the phone or wearing ear buds, and only 35 students (26 percent) were not using any technology. 
The author found it important to observe students’ technology use and habits while with others as 
well. The author found that 38 of 100 students (38 percent) while with others used no technology; 62 percent were either 
texting, talking on the phone, or using a computer or tablet. 
In an effort to determine what impacts technology has on face-to-face communication, the survey 
asked students to rank the statement on a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree: “It bothers me when 
my friends or family use technology while spending time with me.” Seventy-four percent of respondents said 
that they either agreed or strongly agreed with this statement, while only 6 percent disagreed. Among respondents, 
20 percent  neither agreed nor disagreed. 
Another survey question asked students whether they believed the presence of technology, while spending time with others, affects face-to-face interpersonal communication negatively. An overwhelming 92 percent of respondents believed technology negatively affects face-to-face communication, and only 1 percent did not. Only 
7 percent of respondents neither agreed nor disagreed. 
A third question regarding the impacts of technology on face-to-face communication asked students 
whether they noticed quality degradation in conversation amongst the presence of technology. Eighty-nine 
percent of respondents believed there was a degradation, only 5 percent disagreed, and 6 percent neither agreed nor 
disagreed. 
While conducting feld observations, similar results found evident degradation in the quality of con-
versation among those students using technology in the presence of others. One student, observed outside a 
campus building, was FaceTiming an individual on her iPhone. When a friend proceeded to join her in per-
son, the female ignored her friend and continued her conversation on FaceTime. Many students at Lakeside 
Dining Hall ate lunch with their friends, but neglected to engage in any conversation. Instead, a large majority 
of the students in the dining hall sitting with others (73 percent) spent their time texting or using their computers or 
tablets. 
When asked for additional feedback regarding technology use and face-to-face communication, 
students provided a number of insightful responses. One student said, “I don’t like using my phone when I’m 
with friends in person, and I don’t like it when they use theirs, but if it is used in a way to stimulate conversa-
tion – like showing a funny video, or documenting our time together via Snapchat or photos – then I think it is 
acceptable.” Another student agreed, mentioning that whether technology affects face-to-face communication 
positively or negatively depends on how it is used. A third student shared similar opinions stating, “I don’t mind 
if it’s used to enhance a conversation (looking up important information or things relevant to a conversation); 
otherwise, it typically takes away from the experience in general as you can tell the other person(s) attention 
is divided and unfocused on the present moment.” 
Many respondents voiced their concerns that technology is diminishing society’s ability to communi-
cate face to face. One student stated, “People have lost the ability to communicate with each other in face-to-
face interactions,” while another respondent said, “Technology is making face-to-face communication much 
more diffcult because people use technology as a crutch to hide behind.” A third student responded, “I think 
technology impedes our ability to interact with people face to face,” and a fourth agreed that technology “both 
enhances what we share online and decreases what we say face to face.”
Other students shared sentiments that using technology to communicate is acceptable, but when 
used in the presence of others is disrespectful. One student responded, “I think putting away phones and 
technology is a sign of respect when having a conversation with someone and shows that you have their 
full attention. Even though it’s sometimes hard to have those times when people are not attached to their 
phones, I think it is more important than ever.” Many students mentioned that while spending time with friends 
or family, they have to make a conscious effort not to use technology. One respondent said, “At dinners with 
my friends, we do a cell phone tower and the frst to touch the tower has to pay.” It appears that despite being 
aware of their own behaviors and habits regarding technology, the majority of students agree that face-to-face 
communication and the quality of conversations are negatively impacted by technology.

\section{7. Conclusion.}
Field observations, a survey of 100 Elon students, and an analysis of previously conducted studies 
provided evidence that the rapid expansion of technology is negatively affecting face-to-face communica-
tion. People are becoming more reliant on communicating with friends and family through technology and are 
neglecting to engage personally, uninhibited by phones and devices, even when actually in the presence of 
others. A majority of individuals felt the quality of their conversations degraded in the presence of technology, 
and many individuals were bothered when friends or family used technology while spending time together. 
Additionally, nearly half of survey respondents (46 percent) communicate more frequently with friends and family 
via technology than in person, indicating strongly that face-to-face interactions have decreased both in quality 
and in quantity.
Only time will tell what the long-term impacts of this radical shift in communication methods will yield. 
Will employees be less able to communicate with their employers and, therefore, less able to succeed in the workforce? Or will the new skills developed through hours of cell phone use and texting result in a workforce 
that is more nimble and more qualifed to multi-talk? Will Millennials be unable to communicate face to face 
with their children, or will the new tools available to them bring their families closer together? Will the new 
technologies bring us closer together as a community, or result in fewer actual friends and a life that is more 
isolated and less fulflling? With technology advancing at the speed of light and human interaction changing 
just as quickly, it may be impossible to predict the results. However, everyone should be aware that human 
interaction as was once known may have already changed forever.

\section{8. Limitations }

It is important to consider limitations to this study. The survey used a convenience sample, and 
therefore, cannot be generalized to a greater population. Additionally, the survey used a volunteer sample of 
self-selected subjects to participate in the study, potentially bringing about biases. Another potential bias is 
possible because only individuals with a Facebook account had access to the survey, which excluded stu-
dents who do not regularly check or use the social media platform. There was also an extreme gender bias 
since 86 percent of respondents were female, even though females consist of approximately 60% of Elon Univer-
sity’s student body.
